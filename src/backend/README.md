# Backend Directory

This directory is reserved for future backend implementation.

Currently, the project is a static frontend website. When backend functionality is needed (e.g., API endpoints, database connections, server-side logic), it should be implemented here.

## Suggested Structure

```
backend/
├── api/           # API endpoints
├── config/        # Configuration files
├── controllers/   # Business logic
├── models/        # Data models
├── routes/        # Route definitions
└── utils/         # Utility functions
```
